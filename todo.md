# MVP Items

1. DONE - Fix so that search area always appears last
2. Designated areas for stonks, trends? Or make it so these modules can co-exist in the order they're created?
3. OG images
4. Done? Proper error handling
   a. I think we may be okay for an MVP release, but I feel like return data should be standardized.
5. Suggested search for Stonks / Trends?
6. Ability to see actual stonk price (aka two graphs again)
7. DONE - Ensure GT responses are cached unsafe_cache? :thinking:
   a. Just went back to using fetch requests for this, which is stable
8. Ability to delete search areas before a search is completed
9. Ability to change colors of graph lines?
